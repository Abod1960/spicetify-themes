# Spotify Spice

Based on Spotify original theme.

Just like the name of theme, it is Spotify's spice. I don't want to make a lot of modifications, more is to follow my thoughts. I hope to make it more natural and better.

A new version for spicetify v2 click [here](https://github.com/grasonchan/spotify-spice).
